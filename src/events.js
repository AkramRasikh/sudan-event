    location: "Rumis Cave",
    description: "A night that celebrated the Kandaka (Nubian Queen). This evening consisted of incredible talks by strong Sudanese women who tackled the roles of the women, the roles of doctors, and the roles of the youth to name a few in the Sudan uprisings. The night also showcased incredible female talent and was a great space that was all about empowering and elevating the status of the woman.",

    location: "Canalside",
    description: "This event was all about discussing in detail about what the role of the diaspora is in the revolution - particulary post the 3rd June massacre. Many of us have sat and thought what can we actually do. This event broke down our role into political lobbying, social media lobbying and creating a support network. A great campaign was also launched and that was the Fathers Day Campaign where children were encouraged to take an image with their fathers holding signs that say ‘My gift to you dad is ….’ followed by a statement that tackles an issue in Sudan. This campaign was effective in using the fathers day trend to highlight the plight of the Sudanese people",

    location: "Wembley International Hotel",
    description: "A conference looking into how far we have come in the revolution and what is next, by further analysing the role of the youth and women in this revolution and what threats there are to stealing away the revolution from the people. A large segment of the day delved really deep into censorship, social media, student activism, independent investigations into the TMC, appointing a new leader and reducing tensions. This was wrapped up nicely by brainstorming effective action plans and ended with a showcase of incredible Sudanese Talent. With the rapidly changing situation in Sudan it is crucial we continuously keep discussions alive, and re-evaluate what our roles are and what we can do to make this revolution a success.",

The park was also filled with gazebos selling different foods, clothing, and other cultural items. This festival will hopefully be a yearly occurrence, and the organisers hope that with each year the festival becomes more and more representative of ALL African cultures. So make sure you join in next year and get your country represented!",

    name: "Youth Night",
    date: "21st July 2019",
    time: "6pm - 10pm",
    location: "Rumis Cave",
    description: "A night filled with creative talent from different Sudanese and Non - Sudanese performers and good music. The idea of this night was to get the youth socialising and also give them a chance to relax, unwind in a creative environment. The first part of the night was an open mic night encouraging many young talents to come and take the stage, and the second part was taken over by DJ Tijan a Sudanese DJ who got the party started with the biggest UK/US and Sudanese bangers. Whilst tensions are still high in Sudan it is crucial that there are more events/activities that allow the diaspora to unwind, relax, and re-connect with their culture in a positive way. Mental health is and will always be a priority. ",

    time: "1-5pm",
    location: "Richmond Terrace",
    description: "Rape has long been used for politcal gain in Sudan and this revolution has not been any different. A stand/protest was organised to help support all the victims of rape, men, women and children as well as rememberance and solidarity with the martyrs who lost their lives. The stand had the usual passion and vibe that we have seen time and time again from the Sudanese protests with a few NEW English chants. Money was also raised to support the pink for Kandaka campaign, and the Ahfad clinic which will be helping those victims of rape through the selling of items such as t-shirts and bags. Protests are key to our action here in the UK as not only does it show the UK government that we are not going to give up, but it also provides an outlet or a release for the diaspora to exhale out all their anger and hurt.",

    description: "The first ever Youth Led Migrant support clinic will be launching on Sunday. This idea was born out of discussions amongst the Youth who felt that Migration was an issue to be dealt with immediately. Upon discussing with some Migrants a collective agreement was agreed to launch a Migrant Support Clinic that would happen fortnightly. The clinic would help with social and educational support, as well as reading and translating documents, helping with CVs and just generally creating a fun and safe environment for Migrants to come and connect with the wider community. The organisers of the Migrant Support clinic are still looking for volunteers so if you are interested in helping please email: uncensored.hn@gmail.com",
